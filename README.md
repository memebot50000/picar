This is the repo for the Raspberry Pi RC Car project. Important notes:
1. The "3b" folder is for RC cars with one DRIVE MOTOR and one STEERING MOTOR. The directions of the drive motor are **REVERSED** because I have an RC car with rear wheel steering (don't ask why). If using a standard RC car, you will _probably_ need to reverse the directions in the code until I get an update out. 
2. The "0" folder is for RC cars with one LEFT MOTOR and one RIGHT MOTOR. Alternatively, because this code should run on the Pi zero (the smallest and most lightweight 40pin Pi), you could probably use it on anything with a left and right motor (planes, helis, boats, etc).
3. Furthermore, **the names of the folders do not by any means indicate the pi the code should run on**. These are just the Pis _I_ run this code on and I named the folders for my reference. They should be compatable with any 40pin Pi.
4. That aside, this repo also contains various setup scripts I wrote with Perplexity. They are in the setup folder, and I will write more detailed documentation as time permits.
