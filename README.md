This is the repo for the Raspberry Pi RC Car project. Important notes:
1. The "3b" folder is for RC cars with one DRIVE MOTOR and one STEERING MOTOR. The directions of the drive motor are REVERSED because I have an RC car with rear wheel steering (don't ask why).
2. The "0" folder is for RC cars with one LEFT MOTOR and one RIGHT MOTOR. Alternatively, because this code should run on the Pi zero (the smallest and most lightweight 40pin Pi), you could probably use it on anything with a left and right motor (planes, helis, boats, etc).
